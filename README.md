# Hello there! 👋

I am passionate about learning new technologies and using them to develop solutions that optimize people's lives. I am driven by the desire to take on new experiences and challenges to become a well-rounded and experienced professional.
I have over 2 years of experience in software development, creating web and desktop applications focused on solving problems and optimizing processes. To me, writing code without these details in mind is meaningless. Programming is not the final objective, but rather a tool to achieve it.

## About Me

* 2 years of experience in Full-Stack development: Front-End, Back-End, Left-End or Right-End, doesn't matter. You name it, I do it.
* Passionate about automating and improving processes: If it improves the work of other people, I'm all for it.
* I'm a people person: It's not just about technical skills, but about empowering/motivating the people around you. 
* Strong team player, proactive and with excellent problem-solving abilities: Soft-Skills are also important, right ?

## What I'm Working On
